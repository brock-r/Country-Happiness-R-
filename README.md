# Country Happiness

## Goal

The goal of this project is to discover the “Happiness” level of each country and what factors impact this idea of happiness or better known as the quality of life within each country. The conclusions drawn from the results could help global leaders identify the key focus points in keeping the citizens of their country well taken care of.

## Measurement

[The happiness score](https://github.com/brock-r/Country-Happiness-R-/blob/main/HappinessCode/CSVFILES/WorldHappinessReport2018-Score.csv) is based on the findings of The World Happiness
Report which is annually publicized by the United Nations. This score ranks the
overall happiness of a country determined by the results from Gallup World Poll
surveys from 2015-2017. I compared the score with various country-specific data
gathered within [The World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/) related to technology, education, health, and government. With the ultimate goal of discovering which of these factors impact happiness the most and why

Techniques of data wrangling, exploratory data analysis with descriptive statistics, and modelling such as regression analysis are all applied to drawn meaningful conclusions. A final written report summarizes the comprehensive results of the project, which can be found [here]( https://github.com/brock-r/Country-Happiness-R-/blob/main/HappinessCode/Final-Report.pdf).
